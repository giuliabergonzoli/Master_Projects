High School years are a fundamental stage of development for everyone, and it is in the interest of every country to ensure that all students have access to the best possible education and are well integrated into the social system.
We analyzed data related to students of 15 years of age coming from European countries which have a significant number of immigrant students. We observe that immigration is a huge factor limiting foreign students from achieving the same results of their native peers This trend is common to most countries across Europe, but for some worse than others.
In this study we aimed at investigating quantitatively the reasons behind these differences.
